Bucket Pattern

- time-series data, stremaing or IOT devices
- our first initution may to be insert every meaurment into its own document

 {
 sensor_ID: "device123",
 timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:001:00.000Z"),
  temperature: 56
 }
 
  {
 sensor_ID: "device123",
 timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:02:00.000Z"),
  temperature: 34
 }
 
 To enable rapid access to our data we would need to index every sensor_ID and timestamp for each single measurment (at the cost of RAM).
 
 By "bucketing" our information we get improvements in index sizes, query simplicity and pre-aggregation.
 
 {
 sensor_ID: "device123",
 start_date: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:00:00.000Z"),
  start_end: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:59:59.000Z"),
  measurements: [
  {
  timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:01:00.000Z"),
  temperature: 56,
  }
  {
  timestamp: ISODate("2019-01-31T10:02:00.000Z"),
  temperature: 34,
  }
  ],
  transaction_count: 42,
  sum_temperature: 2356
