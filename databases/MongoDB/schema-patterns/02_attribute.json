Attribute Pattern

- used for large collections with similar structure
- a subset of these fields share similar characteristics and we want to sort on these subsets of fields
- the fields we want to sort on are only found in a small subset of documents

- this moving to a key/value convention allows us to deal with rare/unpredictable data fields ("non-deterministic naming") as shown below
- works well with the characteristics of products, common fields (a date), and thus asset management systems

"specs": [
{k: "volume", v: 500, u:"ml"}
{k: "mass", v: 25, u: "gr"}
{k: "hardness", v: "X25", u: "moor-scale"}
]


{
title: "Pulp Fiction",
director: "Quinton Tarantino",
release_US: ISODate("1994-05-20T01:00:00+01:00"),
release_UK ISODate("1994-05-25T01:00:00+01:00")
}

The above approach would require many indexes, instead we can moce the subsets into an array.

{
title: "Pulp Fiction"
director: "Quinton Tarantino",
releases: [
	{
	location: "USA",
	date: ISODate("1994-05-20T01:00:00+01:00")
	},
	{
	location: "UK",
	date: "ISODate("1994-05-25T01:00:00+01:00")
	}
]
}

Indexes thus become: {"releases.location": 1, "releases.date": 1}
