# aeroGarden

#### Project Sketch

Combine off the shelf low-cost gardening trays with an efficient hydration system for indoor year round vegetable/salad growth.

#### Bill of Materials

- *stackable trays to form "garden-tower" (~€4 per unit of 8 pots)*
- *hydration system >>> aeroponic fog dispenser (~€20 per piezo transducer)*
- *mobile elevator system (i.e. motors/gears) for sprayer/s (~€25)*
- *microcontroller (Raspberry Pi 3)*

- *...solar power units*
- *...lighting LEDs*
- *...heating*

#### Compentencies Developed

- *networking, admin, and scripting of Pi*
- *breadboarding, prototyping and parts assembly*
- *mechanical/electrical fundamentals (relays, power, controlling, wiring)* 
- *CAD design*

#### Time Frame

Dec 2017 to approx. June 2018
